OnionWall
=========

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/valldrac/onionwall/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/valldrac/onionwall/commits/master)

Portable router to provide anonymous access to Internet via [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview).

It minimizes the risk of being caught in case an attacker gets into your computer while you are browsing anonymously with [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). It also reduces the potential to make fatal mistakes.

The firmware is based on [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) LEDE 17.01.6.
